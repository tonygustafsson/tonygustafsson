# About me

I've been into coding for 20+ years. :neckbeard: Tried a bunch of different languages, tried backand and frontend. Nowadays I tend to focus most of my time on Frontend development since it's just more fun (challenging). That means my days consists of TypeScript, JavaScript, performance optimization, accessibility, SEO, React, Svelte and bug fixing.

The projects in my repos doesn't really reflect what I produce on a professional level. There is lots of POCs, tests, demos and just old crap. But I'm sure you could find something useful if you look long enough ;) I'm just very pro open source, and it's my philosofy that all code should be open and free. Including mine.

Other interests are photography, cooking/baking, Linux, meditation, blockchains/smart contracts and tech overall. :computer:
