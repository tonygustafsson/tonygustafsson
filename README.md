# About me

I'm working as a frontend developer, but really I do kind of everything that is interesting to me. Because of that I've experiences with frontend, backend, data analytics, network administration and more quirky interests. ðŸ¤“

I prefer working with JavaScript and TypeScript if I have to choose, but I've probably learned 15 languages through the years.

Other interests are photography, cooking/baking, hiking, meditation, blockchains and tech overall.

## What you'll find here

Well, it's not like I'm proud of everything here. Most repos are proof of concepts and pure demos. But some projects are legit, that is used in production today. Nowadays I'm trying to make everything public, as a default.

One of my goals is to help others out, and contribute more to existings repos, instead of running this one man show. ðŸ˜‡
